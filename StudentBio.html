<p><emp>Why do we use it?</emp></p>
<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted 
    by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. 
    The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less
     normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, 
     content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop 
     publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as
      their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will 
      uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions 
      have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
      purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
